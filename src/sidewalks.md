## Lyrics

<pre>
Things that I ignored
Suddenly exposed
Now you're on your own
Finally, so strong

It's all unfair, I feel the gap in heart and I fall through
Oh god, please, make me move
Just take my hand and throw me back to the time when I loved you
There's nothing else to do

Things that I ignored
Suddenly exposed
Now you're on your own
Finally, so strong, yeah

It's all unfair, I feel the gap in heart and I fall through
Oh god, please, make me move
Just take my hand and throw me back to the time when I loved you
There's nothing else to do

Never wonder why this all is mine. It's fine, yeah
Don't come over, why you have to lie? Who's right?

Who's right?
Who's right?
Who's right?
Who's right?
</pre>
